                        <h2>Checking out sucks</h2>
                        <p>Genoapay is a buy now pay later solution, offering consumers 10 weekly interest free instalments for goods and services at participating merchants. Once set up, payments are automatically deducted from a nominated debit or credit card until the payment is paid off. Due to the nature of the product, there are many steps involved, such as credit checking for allocating available funds and ID checking for AML & KYC. This means the checkout process is more complex than a usual credit card online checkout, which already can be cumbersome and lead to high drop off rates.</p>

                        <h2>What can be done?</h2>
                        <p>Talking to customers and analysing user data, several pain points were identified while using Genoapay, as well as general ecommerce checkout experiences.</p>

<p>1. Speed<br>
- Customers just want their stuff! Using the Genoapay product is inherently going to be a pain point, as it is the primary barrier for customers when buying things they want. So, letâ€™s help customers think of Genoapay less as a finance product, and more of a payment method, and while doing so, make them feel great and influence their perception of speed to make it feel faster too.</p>

<p>2. Usability<br>
Reduce input fields, remove verbose copy, add reassuring copy, ensure the steps are logical and expected, reduce cognitive load, make it look pretty. User surveys, as well as heatmaps and user recordings were the main drivers behind this process, and highlighted some surprisingly simple changes that had large usability consequences.</p>

<p>3. Convenience<br>
When a user is choosing between several payment methods, Genoapay should appear as the most convenient option, as most of the standard inputs for an ecommerce checkout are already saved on the users account. This means it can be an express checkout that is easier than a typical credit card purchase.</p>
